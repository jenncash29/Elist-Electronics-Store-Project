### Overview of Findings

Elist Electronics averaged around 27k sales per year from 2019 to 2022, generating approximately $7 million in revenue annually, with an average order value (AOV) of ~$254 USD. The year 2020 saw a dramatic increase in sales, with a 163% rise in total sales compared to 2019. This spike was followed by a gradual return to pre-pandemic sales levels seen in 2019, indicating a normalization of sales post-pandemic. Peak sales periods were consistently observed in November and December, coinciding with holiday seasons and Black Friday promotions.

In terms of growth rates, 2020 was exceptional, with sales and revenue more than doubling compared to 2019. March 2020 marked a significant surge with a 50% increase in total sales and a 46% rise in order count, likely due to increased purchasing during the pandemic.

The loyalty program showed mixed results. From 2019 to 2021, non-members outperformed loyalty members in terms of revenue, AOV, and order count. However, in 2022, loyalty members surpassed non-members across all key metrics, indicating a successful turn in the program's impact.

Refund rates peaked in 2020, with the highest rates recorded for the Macbook Air Laptop. The average order value for refunded items across all years for Apple products was $271 USD.
